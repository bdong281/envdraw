Documentation should probably go here.

TODO:
	- Get interactive mode to refresh the same window instead of drawing a
	  new window after each statement.
	- Handling truly anonymous lambdas
	- Combine the internal GUI objects with their associated internal data
	  structures.  No need to keep the two separate, that gets in the way
	  of allowing dynamic updates to the GUI.
	- Resolve nonlocal bindings and updates correctly.
	- Draw box and pointer diagrams for builtin sequence types.
	- Draw some useful representation of user defined classes.
	- Write a proper test suite and test script.
